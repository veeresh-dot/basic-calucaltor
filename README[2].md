# Basic Calculator

This project is a simple web-based calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations using both on-screen buttons and keyboard input.

## Project Structure

Basic_Calculator/
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js


* `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the calculator, including the display screen and all the interactive buttons.
* `style.css`: Contains all the CSS rules for styling the calculator's layout, buttons, and overall appearance to make it user-friendly and visually appealing.
* `script.js`: Implements the core JavaScript logic for the calculator's functionality. This includes handling button clicks, processing keyboard inputs, performing calculations, and updating the display.

## How to Run and Use the Calculator

Follow these steps to get the calculator running on your local machine:

1.  **Save the Files:**
    * Create a new folder on your computer (e.g., `Basic_Calculator`).
    * Save the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files directly into this new `Basic_Calculator` folder.

2.  **Open `index.html`:**
    * Navigate to the `Basic_Calculator` folder.
    * Double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

## Usage

Once the `index.html` file is open in your browser, you will see a functional calculator interface.

* **On-Screen Buttons:**
    * Click the number buttons (0-9) and the decimal point (`.`) to input numbers.
    * Click the operator buttons (`/`, `*`, `-`, `+`) to perform division, multiplication, subtraction, and addition, respectively.
    * Click the `=` button to calculate and display the result of the expression.
    * Click the `C` (Clear) button to clear the display.
* **Keyboard Input:**
    * You can also type numbers and operators directly using your keyboard.
    * Press `Enter` to calculate the result.
    * Press `Backspace` to delete the last character entered.
    * Press `Escape` to clear the entire display.
* **Error Handling:**
    * If an invalid expression is entered (e.g., incomplete operations), the calculator will display "Error".
